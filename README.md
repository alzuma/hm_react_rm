## Requirements

1. **React Application Setup:**
   - Create a React application with appropriate component structure.
   - Set up routing for different sections of the application.

2. **API Integration:**
   - Utilize the [Rick and Morty API](https://rickandmortyapi.com/) to fetch data for characters.
   - Implement a component to display a list of characters, including their names and images, fetched from the API.

3. **Character Details:**

   - Make the application visually appealing and user-friendly.

## Submission Guidelines
- Host your React project on a platform like GitHub or GitLab.
- Provide a link to the live web application for evaluation.
